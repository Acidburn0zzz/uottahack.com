    - question: "+ Can I work on a project I've already started?"
      answer: >
        As awesome as your project is sure to be, it'll have to wait on the sidelines during the hackathon. All projects must be started from scratch at the event, but you're free to think up an idea for one!
    - question: "+ How much will it cost me?"
      answer: >
        **Nothing at all!** Attending the hackathon is completely free, including any meals during the hackathon.
    - question: "+ Are newbie programmers and hackers allowed?"

        Of course! Hackathons are all about learning new things and having an amazing experience. We'll have plenty of workshops and mentors during the event to help you out!
    - question: "+ Can high school students come?"
      answer: >
        **Yes!** We highly encourage younger high school students to apply and come get creative! Minors attending will be asked to have waivers signed by their parents/ guardians.
    - question: "+ I think I'd rather help others learn instead of making my own hack - can I still come?"
      answer: >
        **Yes!** If you're experienced in CS and would like to be a student mentor, drop us a line at [hi@uottahack.com](mailto:plee032@uottawa.ca).
    - question: "+ Sounds great, but what do I win?"
      answer: >
        We started uOttaHack to empower students in creating innovative, fun, and awesome projects, without the stress of a regular semester's weekend. The real reward you will get are the friends you make that last a lifetime, and an experince you won't forget. With that said, you'll have the chance to demo to our diverse panel of judges and the top teams will be rewarded with sweet prizes! There will also be smaller prizes for specific categories and potentially some given out by our sponors.

        They work with over 200 Member Events and empower over 70,000 students every year.
    - question: "+ Is there a code of conduct?"
